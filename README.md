## Features
- **User Management:** Secure user registration and login for both recipe owners and general users.
- **Content Creation:** Recipe owners can securely upload, edit, and delete their recipes.
- **Dynamic Content:** Recipes are stored in a database and rendered dynamically.
- **Tech Stack:** PHP, HTML, CSS, and a relational database (e.g., MySQL).
